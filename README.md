# WindowsForms Book Selector
Will pull from any and all .txt files in the same directory as the .exe.
Can save the contents of the files to an Xml for later use.
For now input files must be in format: 
- Book Title
- Book Author
- Book Genre
- Number of Pages
Any books whose genre is not supported ie. does not have a sort button
on the form will me marked as "Other" genre.
The other genre is included in all searches and randomization currently.
